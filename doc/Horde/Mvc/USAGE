To actually define and work with an entity

Overload RepositoryFactory to load a suitable backend
Overload Horde_Mvc_Model_EntityFactory to define a FieldList and pass it to a new Horde_Mvc_Model_Entity
Overload Horde_Mvc_Model_Entity to get an appropriate classname (Suggest the factory classname minus Factory)

TODO: Should we look for a missing entity name and create by default to reduce boilerplates?
